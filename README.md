# CCM_at_semeval2025task4: A balanced forgetting and retention multi-task framework using effective unlearning loss
This is the official repository for our paper at SemEval2025 Task4.

##Abstract
As the Large Language Model (LLM) gains widespread adoption, increasing attention has been given to the challenge of making LLM forget non-compliant data memorized during its pre-training. Machine Unlearning focuses on efficiently erasing sensitive information from LLM under limited computational resources. To advance research in this area, SemEval 2025 Task 4: "Unlearning Sensitive Content from Large Language Models" introduces three unlearning datasets and establishes a benchmark by evaluating both forgetting effectiveness and the preservation of standard capabilities. In this work, we propose a more controllable forgetting loss, Effective Unlearning Loss, and explore its integration with various techniques to achieve more efficient and controlled unlearning. Our system ultimately ranked 5th on the competition leaderboard.
