Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.

In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day.

He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.
We believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.""

""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

Remember Sharpeville

Because it epitomized oppression
and the nature of society
More clearly than anything else;

Nowhere is racial dominance

nowhere the will to oppress
more clearly demonstrated

apartheid declares with snarling guns

South Africa spills dust

Remember bullet-in-the-back day
And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
Remember the dead

That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.
Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s
The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

""Let a woman retire late to bed, but rise early to duties; let her nor dread tasks by day or by night. Let her not refuse to perform domestic duties whether easy or difficult. That which must be done, let her finish completely, tidily, and systematically, When a woman follows such rules as these, then she may be said to be industrious.
Let a woman be correct in manner and upright in character in order to serve her husband. Let her live in purity and quietness of spirit, and attend to her own affairs. Let her love not gossip and silly laughter. Let her cleanse and purify and arrange in order the wine and the food for the offerings to the ancestors. When a woman observes such principles as these, then she may be said to continue ancestral worship.
No woman who observes these three fundamentals of life has ever had a bad reputation or has fallen into disgrace. If a woman fail to observe them, how can her name be honored; how can she but bring disgrace upon herself?""

All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness.

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
According to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?",They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.,They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.,They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.,They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.,C,True,0.17866723239421844,0.25995931029319763,0.4286004304885864,0.10836715996265411

And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.

Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.""

Firstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.
Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.
Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…
…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only.

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.""

I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.

The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.

At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.

This ruler of Syria made me spend many years as commander of his army,
Every land to which I turned
I overcame.
I destroyed its green fields and its wells,
I captured its cattle, I took captive its inhabitants, I deprived them of their provisions,
and I slew [many] people…by my sword, my bow, my marchings, and my good devices.
Thus my excellence was in his heart; he loved me and he knew my valor;
…he set me at the head of his sons, when he saw the success of my handiwork.
There came a champion of Syria
to defy me in my tent;
a bold man without equal, for he had vanquished all his rivals.
He said, ""Let Sanehat fight with me.""
He thought to overcome me; he designed to take my cattle, thus being counseled by his tribe.

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.

This great purity of the French Revolution is precisely what causes both our strength and our weakness. Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.

""Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.""

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

As for their men there is no sexual jealousy in them. And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.].

Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.

Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy.

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

is not that seventy died:
nor even that they were shot in the back
retreating, unarmed, defenceless
and certainty not
the heavy caliber slug
that tore through a mother's back
and ripped through the child in her arms

Remember Sharpeville
bullet-in-the-back day
Because it epitomized oppression
and the nature of society
More clearly than anything else;
it was the classic event
Nowhere is racial dominance
more clearly defined
nowhere the will to oppress
more clearly demonstrated

apartheid declares with snarling guns
the blood the rich lust after
South Africa spills dust

Remember bullet-in-the-back day
And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
Remember the dead

Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life.

Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?

""The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.""

She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense.

Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.

Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians.

At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.""

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.

When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . .

The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . .

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
