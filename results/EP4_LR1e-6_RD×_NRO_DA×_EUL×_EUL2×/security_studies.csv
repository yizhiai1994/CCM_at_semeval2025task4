Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?,"The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all.

In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?,State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.,"With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.",The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.,The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.,B,False,0.0070770722813904285,0.00908714160323143,0.027990365400910378,0.027990365400910378

How can the origins of weak state insecurity be explained?,Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.,The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.,"The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.",Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood.

How do biological differences affect the roles that men and women must perform for the state?,"Biology determines the female body as weak, ensuring that men continue to dominate state security apparatus in order to protect them.

What are the themes that make post-structuralism a different field of study and why is it criticized?,"One of the founding assumptions of Critical Security Studies is that theories about the world constitute that world and thus that theory, including security theory, has political effects. The consequence is that theory is the product of the system, and that analyses of the agent of security and the referent object is produced by its own practices.","Central to the political and critical nature of post-structural literature is the idea of fostering an ethos of democracy and an ethos of critique which is finite and attainable.

What has been the impact of nuclear deterrence on international politics post-Cold War?,"There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur.","Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain.","Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts.","Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians.

In practice this means that the coercer must be militarily superior and capable of denying their opponent the ability to realize their agenda and impose costs that directly threaten their interests.,To maximize credibility a threat of quick defeat backed by the required military capability is insufficient.

What are Fission Nuclear Weapons?,Fission nuclear weapons are gun-type devices that require a relatively small amount of fissile uranium-235 material to produce a comparatively large explosion because mass and energy becomes interchangeable in the barrel.

However, as a preventative method it has been questioned and it is argued to resemble concessionary politics.","Prevention is conceived as securing the physical integrity of targets and key political installations, particularly weapons installations, national buildings, national or cultural symbols, or defence deployments. Protecting possible targets of the state enhances the wellbeing of more vulnerable targets. Terrorists may move to more convenient territory to target their objectives which make it more difficult to control.",A,False,0.014462803490459919,0.027020074427127838,0.016388503834605217,0.04454857110977173
In what ways can a distinction be made between limited force and full-scale force?,The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage.,Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Military action always results from a failure of negotiations and from a shift from the diplomatic to the military sphere.,"The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed.","The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.",D,False,0.00891129206866026,0.014692235738039017,0.03524484112858772,0.031103461980819702
What are the challenges for the future of security studies?,"The most obvious issue of joint concern during the 2000s was terror and order, although fast- rising concerns over environmental/climate security could easily provide another big linking issue.",The fate of security studies depends on its ability to prevail in the general debates in the discipline of IR. It is very unlikely that the internal dynamics of the theory debate will be decided by a general prevalence of one of the current debates.,"Both the US and European analysts will be working on the role and nature of technology, globalization, risk society and the international economic order. This picture shows that there will be a lot of points of contact between the currently disconnected fields of theory.",All of these options.,D,True,0.028831543400883675,0.02245403081178665,0.04194965213537216,0.12921400368213654

Why is coercive diplomacy hard? What are the inherent difficulties?,"Perpetual, psychological and emotional factors are precluded from the adversary's calculations. In no-win situations therefore the adversary might calculate that temporary compliance is the best strategic option to buy time.",Coercive diplomacy leaves too much room for compromise. Actors engaging in such behaviour are unlikely to perceive their vital interests as threatened and regard issues as zero-sum because they are aware that force will be used. As a consequence coercive diplomacy can lead to lengthy resolution discussions.,"The success ultimately rests on perceptual, psychological and emotional factors, giving rise to the risk that misperception or miscalculation will defeat even a well-executed strategy that otherwise meets all the requirements for success.","The political scope for offering inducements can become unlimited. The problem becomes particularly underlined when the risk of terrorism, WMD or equal military capability comes into play. Inducements can appear to look like concessionary politics and blur the line of what constitutes a success defined as the fear of inescapable escalation.",C,True,0.019424745813012123,0.02826283685863018,0.08705566823482513,0.02826283685863018
