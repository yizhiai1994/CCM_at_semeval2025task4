Jeremy P. E. Spencer is a British biochemist, specialising in nutrition and cognitive function. He is Professor of Molecular Nutrition at the Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences of the University of Reading. He is an Institute for Scientific Information highly-cited researcher.
Biography.
Spencer studied Biochemistry at the University of Warwick and completed his PhD in Medical Biochemistry/Pharmacology at King's College London. Following several years as postdoctoral research fellow, at UC Davis and King's College London, he became a lecturer in Biochemistry at the King's College London GKT School of Medical Education. Since 2004, he is at the Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences at the University of Reading. He has received numerous awards, including the Silver Medal of the British Nutrition Society.
Research.
Spencer's research is focused on the interface between dietary phytochemicals and brain function. His initial work focused on",the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal death in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. He could show that flavonoids and other polyphenols act as signalling molecules and not antioxidants in vivo.," the deposition of metabolic products in the brain after dietary exposure. He saw this as a potential problem in biology and medicine, and spent many years trying to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying brain damage from dietary exposure.
In 2011, he published an important paper that went beyond comparing the chemical destruction of the brain during digestion to other animals. They found that the brain also receives a physical damage during digestion in the first place, because the gastrointestinal tract physically severs the connection between the brain and the rest of the body. This was a long-known phenomenon, but Spencer and his colleagues for the first time showed that it is physically painless, which has been a topic of discussion in the medical community for years.",0.5916872620582581
