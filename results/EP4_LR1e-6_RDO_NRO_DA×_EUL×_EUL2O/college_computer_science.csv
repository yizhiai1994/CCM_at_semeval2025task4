"Function signatures describe the types of the arguments to a function as well as the return value of the function. For instance, the addition function on reals has a signature of
add : real x real -> real
since it takes two real numbers and returns a real number. But, for a language that allows functions as return values, addition could be considered to have the signature
add : real -> (real -> real)
