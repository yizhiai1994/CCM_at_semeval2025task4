Saint Pergat or Pergad or Pergobat or Bergat was a sixth-century Brenton bishop contemporary with Saint Ruelin. He is regarded as a saint in local Brenton calendars: His feast day August 3rd.
Biography.
Pergat was born into a noble and wealthy family around 548. He was a student of the Breton monk Tugdual who established a hermitage on an island off the coast of North Wales. Pergat accompanied Tugdual when the latter returned to Brittany, probably settling at Yaudet near Lannion.
A good speaker, Pergat became Canon and Archdeacon of Lexobia. On the death of Tugdual, he contested the election of bishop Ruelin and, supported by a part of the people and clergy, was also elected. To settle this schism, a synod was summoned to Lexobia, marked by an apparition of Tugdual, who threatened Pergat with a terrible and rapid punishment if he did not withdraw. Pergat knelt down, begged pardon, and retired to Pouldouran,",of which he is still the patron saint and where a fountain bearing his name exists. He ended his days by doing penitence as a hermit at Ty-Bergat. He died around 620.," of which he is the current bishop.
He has been on and off the synodical list of the the Church of England.
