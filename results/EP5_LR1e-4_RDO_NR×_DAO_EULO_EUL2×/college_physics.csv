If a positronium atom makes a transition from the state with n=3 to a state with n=1, the energy of the photon emitted in this transition is closest to",6.0 e,6.8 eV,12.2 eV,13.6 eV,A,False,0.00048516850802116096,0.005216052755713463,0.9940037131309509,0.00029426958644762635
A satellite of mass m orbits a planet of mass M in a circular orbit of radius R. The time required for one revolution is,independent of M,proportional to m^(1/2),linear in R,proportional to R^(3/2),D,False,0.0012669702991843224,0.0018434309167787433,0.9549208283424377,0.04195629432797432
